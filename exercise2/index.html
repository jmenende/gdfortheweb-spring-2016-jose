	<h1 class="sans">Reputations: Josef Müller-Brockmann</h1>
	<p class="yss">YSS: What do you regard as your best work?</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: The white reverse sides of my posters!</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: What was your most creative period?</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: My most creative period was in fact the worst because at that time my work was still illustrative. But this period of discovery and clarification eventually led to the rich productivity of my 40s.</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: You were influenced by Carl Jung, but then lost interest. Why was that?</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: As a young man I was intrigued not only by psychology but also by graphology. When I met people who interested me I would read their handwriting and was rarely wrong in my judgements. But this gift began to disturb me, especially in my dealings with clients, where it would unnecessarily prejudice discussion. So I abandoned it overnight. Later I paid the price for giving up these analyses when I took on partners and employees whose handwriting would have given me an early warning of trouble ahead.</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: What is the source of your efforts to clarify everything and aspire to what is eternally valid? Is it a protest against death, or a fear of looking behind the picture to the unconscious?</p>
	<p class="jmb">	JMB: The unconscious is part of the support structure: everything that is stored there comes to light in the work process. What I try to achieve in my work is to communicate information about an idea, event or product as clearly as possible. Such a down-to-earth presentation is barely affected by present-day trends. But it is not so much a question of making a statement that will be valid for all time as of being able to communicate information to the recipient in a way that leaves him or her free to form a positive or negative opinion.</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: You work to quite a definite rational model, though life for the most part unfolds intuitively.</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: But the model is always individual. Had you asked me 40 years ago, I would have been more confident in my defence of the rules than I am today. I have changed. Personality is defined in two ways: what is inherited and what is consciously assimilated. In my case, reading has broadened my knowledge, and my intuition, inspiration and emotions stem from what I have taken in. But rules are important. Laws enable multitudes of people to live together – no nation can exist without laws. They favour the freedom of the many at the expense of the individual.</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: Why is the measurable, the demonstrable, so fascinating?</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: The greatest works of art impress through their balance, their harmony, their proportions, all of which can be measured. That is one of the reasons why paintings, sculptures and buildings that are thousands of years old – by the Egyptians, Chinese, Assyrians and so on – are still fascinating to us today. Mondrian, on the other hand, did not use measurements and therefore took a long time to do a painting. However, few artists possess as much intelligence, sensibility and intuition as Mondrian.</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: So did you trust to intuition in your illustrative period?</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: Yes, because I wanted to explore the limits of my artistic ability. Until I was 30 I had been trying out various styles and techniques to find out where my talent might lie. I had quite a lot of apparent success with my illustrative work, but as a result of my ruthless self-critical analysis I saw that I possessed no essential artistic talent beyond the ordinary, and the creativity of a mediocre person is of no general interest. You can’t learn to become an artist, but you can learn to become a useful graphic artist. Intensive study of typography will reveal its laws, and the same holds for photography and compositions using typographical, photographic and graphic elements.</p>
	<p class="yss">YSS: So you opted for clear-sighted reason, for reducing things to their essentials – to serve a democratic purpose?</p>
	<p class="jmb">JMB: I have always known that my illustrations, drawings and paintings are entertainment. They were quite good, but harmless. I was also successful in using a mix of surrealistic illustration and factual information in exhibition designs in the 1940s and 1950s, but the lack of objectivity disturbed me. So for the “Landi 1964” [the Swiss regional exhibition], I eschewed all playfulness and subjectivity and arrived at an objective typographic-pictorial solution.</p>

	<p class="no-indent sans">Bayer’s work for the CCA was rather wide-ranging. 
	He supplied advertising art, created a corporate identity (including a new logo), 
	designed factories and workspaces, oversaw the Great Ideas
