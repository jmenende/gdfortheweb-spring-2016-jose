		<strong><span>Joiri Minaya: Redecode</strong></span><br> 

		<span>Redecode</a>: a tropical theme</span><br> 

			<span><br><img src="photo27.jpg"></span><br>

		<span><br>is a great way to create a fresh,</span>
		<span>peaceful, relaxing atmosphere</span>  
		<span>is derived from two wallpapers</span>
		<span>designed in the 1940s</span>
		<span>for sumptuous redecorations</span>
		<span>in luxurious hotels in the United States</span> 
		<span>Recalling scientific illustrations,</span> 
		<span>the original patterns belong to a style popularized</span>  
		<span>at midcentury. Names such as Brazilliance,</span> 
		<span>designed for the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia</span> 
		<span>by Dorothy Draper, and Martinique Banana Leaf,</span>  
		<span>designed for the Beverly Hills Hotel by Don</span>  
		<span>Loper allude to their relationship to tropical</span> 
		<span>landscapes. This stylistic interest coincides</span>
		<span>with the peak period of U.S. interventions</a></span><br>
		<span><br>into Latin America and the Caribbean. These</span> 
		<span>designs and their names offer a way to explore</span>  
		<span>some of the constructed notions of fantasy,</span> 
		<span>exoticism, pleasure, domestication, and consumerism</span><br>

			<span><br><img src="photo32.jpg"></span><br> 

		<span><br>associated with the tropical landscape and its</span> 
		<span>subjects that still prevail today.</span><br>
