	<span><br>This exhibition features a selection</span> 
	<span>of recent acquisitions to El Museo&rsquo;s</span> 
	<span>permanent collection.</span><br> 
		<span><br><img src="photo35.jpg"></span>  

	<span>It includes</span>  
	<span>our most recent gift,</span> 
	<span>a large painting by David Antonio Cruz,</span>
	<span><a href="museo4a.html">Puerto Rican Pieta</a>, a portrait</span>
	<span>of the artist and his mother.</span> 
	<span>Works of photography, prints,</span><br> 
	<span>sculpture, and ceramics accompany</span>
	<span>paintings in this multi-media</span>  
	<span>exhibition that highlights</span>  
	<span>the iconic presence of the human</span> 
	<span>form in various ways. Quiet moments</span>  
	<span>of (self) reflection are seen</span> 
	<span>as are individual statements</span>  
	<span>about the possibilities of a</span>  
	<span>particular material, such as wood,</span> 
	<span>ceramics, or the photograph.</span>
