		<strong><span>Sarah Zapata: Siempre X</strong></span><br> 
			<span><br><img src="photo30.jpg"></span><br> 

		<span><br>As part of its ongoing ARTE NUEVO series,</span>  
		<span>El Museo del Barrio invites artists</span>  
		<span>to propose unique, site-specific works</span>  
		<span>for its large wall in El Cafe. In this case,</span>  
		<span>sculptor and textile artist Sarah Zapata</span> 
		<span>spent several weeks in Peru studying indigenous</span> 
		<span>textile design and techniques, which she incorporated</span>
		<span>into this large work. The artist is interested</span>  
		<span>in the intersection of popular and traditional</span> 
		<span>cultures as well as in a mix of natural</span> 
		<span>and fabricated materials. She has also been deeply</span> 
		<span>inspired by ariplleras, hand-sewn narrative works</span> 
		<span>that were made in Chile during the Pinochet dictatorship</span> 
		<span>and also throughout the guerilla occupation in Peru.</span> 
		<span>Made almost exclusively by women, these were an important</span> 
		<span>political tool, sometimes the only way that information</span>  
		<span>about the violence and repression could be disseminated</span>  
		<span>to other countries. The artist adapts these hand-made</span> 
		<span>techniques and ideas to a monumental scale</span>  
		<span>and incorporates plastic elements that are reminiscent</span>  
		<span>of pop culture imagery.</span>
